## **Device & Fix Details**

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Device Name** | Infinix Note 11 |
| **Codename** | X663 |
| **SoC** | MediaTek Helio G88 (MT6769H) |
| **Target OS** | GSI - Android 14+ |
| **Problem Solved** | WiFi - Mobile Data (Internet) Connectivity |

## **The Problem**

When flashing any modern GSI (e.g., AOSP A15 or DerpFest A16) on the Infinix Note 11 (X663), the device boots correctly, but **WiFi - Mobile Data fails to work entirely BUT If we started HOTSPOT Sharing ... the other device can connect to our internet normally**. This is a known issue on many MediaTek devices and requires a specific patch to the kernel within the `boot.img` to enable the necessary BPF layer for network function.

---

## **The Solution**

1.First try using ```adb shell settings put global restricted_networking_mode 0```

2.The **`mtk-bpf-patcher`** has been successfully applied to the stock `boot.img` to ensure mobile data works correctly with modern GSIs.

### **Included Files**

1.  **`stock_boot.img`**: The original, unpatched boot image from the stock firmware. **(For reference or restoration purposes).**
2.  **`patched_boot_bpf_fix.img`**: The patched boot image with the BPF fix applied. **(This is the file you need to flash).**

## **Flashing Instructions**

⚠️ **WARNING:** Flashing custom images carries inherent risks. I am not responsible for any damage to your device. Ensure your device is the **Infinix Note 11 (X663)** and you have Fastboot/ADB access.

### **Prerequisites**

1.  ADB/Fastboot binaries and drivers installed on your PC.
2.  Your device's **Bootloader must be unlocked**.
3.  A GSI (Android 14 or higher) must already be installed.

### **Steps**

1.  Download the **`patched_boot_bpf_fix.img`** file to an easily accessible folder on your computer (e.g., your ADB folder).
2.  Reboot your phone into **Fastboot Mode** (usually by powering off, then holding Volume Down while connecting the USB cable).
3.  Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in your ADB/Fastboot directory.
4.  Verify your device is connected:
    ```bash
    adb devices
    ```
5.  Restart to bootloader
    ```bash
    adb reboot bootloader  
    ```
6.  Enter fastbootd Mode
    ```bash
    fastboot reboot fastboot 
    ```
7.  Flash the patched boot image:
    ```bash
    fastboot flash boot patched_boot_bpf_fix.img
    ```
8.  Once flashing is complete, reboot your device:
    ```bash
    fastboot reboot
    ```

**Result:** WiFi - Mobile Data connectivity should now be correctly enabled on your installed GSI.
